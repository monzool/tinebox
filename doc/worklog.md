## File informaion

Huh? Apparently there is no built-in file support in gleam ü§î

Google didn't find much, but a few hits pointed to https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_erlang/. However, that repo didn't seem to have any file handling. After some digging in the history, it was clear that it **had** had some file handling features, but those had been [deprecated](https://github.com/gleam-lang/erlang/commit/9d72bd00caf5ec80ffbafb2a75c6d29b1d1477c5)

```gleam
@deprecated("Use the simplifile package instead")
@external(erlang, "gleam_erlang_ffi", "file_info")
```


Could not figure out how file handling works to get file information so resorted to ask on the gleam discord channel


>Hi

>After some initial confusion I realized that a library is needed for file handling üòÖ Alright üòä I've then learned that file operations was in the gleam/erlang/file library, which then deprecated (https://github.com/gleam-lang/erlang/commit/9d72bd00caf5ec80ffbafb2a75c6d29b1d1477c5) and now simplifile is the recommended library.

Nice!

## svn status

#svn/status

### svn status kind

svn do not list the kind (file/directory/symlink) when added

```sh
‚ù± svn st
A       dir1/dir1_file1.txt
A       dir2

‚ù± svn st --xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<status>
  <target path=".">
    <entry path="9407031305">
      <wc-status props="none" item="unversioned">
</wc-status>
    </entry>
    <entry path="dir1/dir1_file1.txt">
      <wc-status props="none" item="added" revision="-1">
</wc-status>
    </entry>
    <entry path="dir2">
      <wc-status props="none" item="added" revision="-1">
</wc-status>
    </entry>
    <entry path="‚Äìt">
      <wc-status item="unversioned" props="none">
</wc-status>
    </entry>
    <entry path="‚Äìtr">
      <wc-status props="none" item="unversioned">
</wc-status>
    </entry>
  </target>
</status>
```

When committed, `svn list` can show the kind


```sh
‚ù± svn list --xml | xmllint --format -
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<lists>
  <list path=".">
    <entry kind="dir">
      <name>dir1</name>
      <commit revision="4">
        <author>jsso</author>
        <date>2024-02-29T19:17:02.225074Z</date>
      </commit>
    </entry>
    <entry kind="file">
      <name>first_file.txt</name>
      <size>20</size>
      <commit revision="4">
        <author>jsso</author>
        <date>2024-02-29T19:17:02.225074Z</date>
      </commit>
    </entry>
```


### svn status timestamp

svn status can show the date of when the file was **added** to svn.

```sh
‚ù± svn add dir2 dir1/dir1_file1.txt
A         dir2
A         dir1/dir1_file1.txt

‚ù± touch -a -m -t 203801181205.09 dir1/dir1_file1.txt
‚ù± ll dir1/dir1_file1.txt
Permissions User Group Size      Date Modified              Name
.rw-rw-r--  jsso jsso  0 B  2038-01-18 Mon 12:05:09 ÔÖú dir1/dir1_file1.txt

‚ù± svn st --xml -v | grep -Ei '(date|path)'
   path=".">
   path=".">
<date>2024-02-29T19:17:02.225074Z</date>
   path="9407031305">
   path="dir1">
<date>2024-02-29T19:17:02.225074Z</date>
   path="dir1/dir1_file1.txt">
   path="dir2">
   path="first_file.txt">
<date>2024-02-29T19:17:02.225074Z</date>
   path="second_file.txt">
<date>2024-02-27T17:33:50.801252Z</date>
```


### svn status conclusions

#conclusion/svn/status

- It cannot determine kind (file/directory/symlink), but it most likely not needed for anything. Alternatively is must be probed manually
- Cannot be used for getting file timestamp
- Use `-q` flag to ignore untracked items
- It can be used for getting a list of files added

    ```sh
    ‚ù± svn st -q | awk '{ print $2 }'
    dir1/dir1_file1.txt
    dir2
    ```


## svn add

Should probably just simply pass to `svn add` every file added, that resides within the repo

## Iterate a file list

How do I get the first item from a list and unwrap it so I get the actual value?

First tried

```
let file1 = result.unwrap(list.first(files), "")
```

Not awesome. The default value makes no sense. I know that I can pattern match, but as there is not early exit, how do I structure this?

Oh. Pattern matching is going to be weird also

```
case list.first(files) {
  [first, ..rest] -> first
  _ -> "what to do here?"
}
```

Lets just iterate'em all. Then I can use `map`.
Using maps works, excepts that it is not suitable if I want to stop at first error. I think I should just stop first time I get an error where I can't collect the meta data. Failure would probably not be a one off, but instead permission or unmount issue.
Searching a bit, found that javascript use `Some` or `find` for this. Gleam list type has a `find` function


## Getting file information

The `FileInfo` type added in simplifile-1.5.0 is pretty nice.


```gleam
let file_info = simplifile.file_info(file)
```
This give me a result wrapped 'FileInfo`.
For now I just store it in a meta record

```gleam
type MetaData {
  MetaData(filename: String, mtime: Result(String, simplifile.FileError))
]
```


## Gleam formatting bug

Found a bug in the formatter

```gleam
let mtime =
  file_info
  |> result.map(with: fn(info) {
    info.mtime_seconds
    |> birl.from_unix
    |> birl.to_iso8601
    // |> io.debug
    // #(file, info.mtime_seconds)
  })
```

After saving, the formatter changes this by moving the commented lines

```gleam
let mtime =
  file_info
  |> result.map(with: fn(info) {
    info.mtime_seconds
    |> birl.from_unix
    |> birl.to_iso8601
  })

// |> io.debug
// #(file, info.mtime_seconds)
```

## Try out `fold_until`

So how to break from a map operation if error? Best fit I could find was `fold_until`. That can return a `list.Continue` in good case, or `list.Stop` in error cases
Looks like the return type is the same for both cases. That won't work directly, as I then can't identify success from error. Have to use a `result` type I figure

So `fold` functions need a starting seed, Guess I can use an empty list for starting.
First basic tryout

```gleam
fn get_file_info(files) {
  let metadata =
    files
    |> list.fold_until(Ok([]), fn(acc, i) {
      let meta = MetaData(i, "dummy mtime")
      let res = result.map(acc, fn(values) { list.append(values, [meta]) })

      list.Continue(res)
    })
}
```

Result:
>Ok([MetaData("first_file.txt", "dummy mtime"), MetaData("second_file.txt", "dummy mtime")])


## Using `fold_until`

Okay got a solution. There are some issues...maybe

```gleam
fn get_file_info(files) {
  let metadata =
    files
    |> list.fold_until(Ok([]), fn(acc, i) {
      let mtime = get_file_mtime(i)
      case mtime {
        Ok(mtime) ->
          list.Continue(
            result.map(acc, fn(values) {
              list.append(values, [MetaData(i, mtime)])
            }),
          )
        Error(file_error) -> list.Stop(Error(file_error))
      }
    })
}
```

The `acc` is a `result` type, so I need to unwrap it, to append to the boxed list. Here I only use `map` and ignores any errors. As a human I know that this will never error, but the code could look like an only semi-handled situation?

If feeding a list of valid files, it will return a `Ok` result of list. In case of an invalid file, it stops on first error


# 2024-03-18

Settled on the following file instance type

```gleam
type MetaData {
  MetaData(filename: String, mtime: Result(String, simplifile.FileError))
}
```

The resulting type from a file traversal will be

```gleam
  Result(MetaData(filename: String, mtime: Result(String, simplifile.FileError)))
```

The outer `Result` will inform:
- Ok ü¢° all file operations succeded
- Error ü¢° file of first error

More meta data are to be collected, but for now the following is collected as the `mtime` member:
- Ok ü¢° a iso8601 timestamp (`Ok("2024-02-27T17:33:31.000Z")`)
- Error ü¢° a simplify file error (`Error(Enoent)`)

A success result might be like this

`Ok([MetaData("first_file.txt", Ok("2024-02-27T17:45:53.000Z")), MetaData("second_file.txt", Ok("2024-02-27T17:33:31.000Z"))])`

while an error could be like this

`Error([MetaData("/non/existing/file", Error(Enoent))])`

Both success and failure are list results. In the error case, this might not be needed now, as it stops on first error, but it simplifies the generating code. And if wanting to parallelize it might be easier for collecting errors, and then just presenting the first item ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
