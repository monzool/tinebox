Created the repo [on github](https://github.com/monzool/tinebox).
Generated a gleam project with `gleam new tinebox`

## Libraries

#libraries

Found some libraries that I perhaps would use

## File informaion

Huh? Apparently there is no built-in file support in gleam ü§î

Google didn't find much, but a few hits pointed to https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_erlang/. However, that repo didn't seem to have any file handling. After some digging in the history, it was clear that it **had** had some file handling features, but those had been [deprecated](https://github.com/gleam-lang/erlang/commit/9d72bd00caf5ec80ffbafb2a75c6d29b1d1477c5)

```gleam
@deprecated("Use the simplifile package instead")
@external(erlang, "gleam_erlang_ffi", "file_info")
```


Could not figure out how file handling works to get file information so resorted to ask on the gleam discord channel

>After some initial confusion I realized that a library is needed for file handling üòÖ Alright üòä I've then learned that file operations was in the gleam/erlang/file library, which then deprecated (https://github.com/gleam-lang/erlang/commit/9d72bd00caf5ec80ffbafb2a75c6d29b1d1477c5) and now simplifile is the recommended library.

I very quickly got a response

Nice!

## svn status

#svn/status

### svn status kind

svn do not list the kind (file/directory/symlink) when added

```sh
‚ù± svn st
A       dir1/dir1_file1.txt
A       dir2

‚ù± svn st --xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<status>
  <target path=".">
    <entry path="9407031305">
      <wc-status props="none" item="unversioned">
</wc-status>
    </entry>
    <entry path="dir1/dir1_file1.txt">
      <wc-status props="none" item="added" revision="-1">
</wc-status>
    </entry>
    <entry path="dir2">
      <wc-status props="none" item="added" revision="-1">
</wc-status>
    </entry>
    <entry path="‚Äìt">
      <wc-status item="unversioned" props="none">
</wc-status>
    </entry>
    <entry path="‚Äìtr">
      <wc-status props="none" item="unversioned">
</wc-status>
    </entry>
  </target>
</status>
```

When committed, `svn list` can show the kind


```sh
‚ù± svn list --xml | xmllint --format -
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<lists>
  <list path=".">
    <entry kind="dir">
      <name>dir1</name>
      <commit revision="4">
        <author>jsso</author>
        <date>2024-02-29T19:17:02.225074Z</date>
      </commit>
    </entry>
    <entry kind="file">
      <name>first_file.txt</name>
      <size>20</size>
      <commit revision="4">
        <author>jsso</author>
        <date>2024-02-29T19:17:02.225074Z</date>
      </commit>
    </entry>
```


### svn status timestamp

svn status can show the date of when the file was **added** to svn.

```sh
‚ù± svn add dir2 dir1/dir1_file1.txt
A         dir2
A         dir1/dir1_file1.txt

‚ù± touch -a -m -t 203801181205.09 dir1/dir1_file1.txt
‚ù± ll dir1/dir1_file1.txt
Permissions User Group Size      Date Modified              Name
.rw-rw-r--  jsso jsso  0 B  2038-01-18 Mon 12:05:09 ÔÖú dir1/dir1_file1.txt

‚ù± svn st --xml -v | grep -Ei '(date|path)'
   path=".">
   path=".">
<date>2024-02-29T19:17:02.225074Z</date>
   path="9407031305">
   path="dir1">
<date>2024-02-29T19:17:02.225074Z</date>
   path="dir1/dir1_file1.txt">
   path="dir2">
   path="first_file.txt">
<date>2024-02-29T19:17:02.225074Z</date>
   path="second_file.txt">
<date>2024-02-27T17:33:50.801252Z</date>
```


### svn status conclusions

#conclusion/svn/status

- It cannot determine kind (file/directory/symlink), but it most likely not needed for anything. Alternatively is must be probed manually
- Cannot be used for getting file timestamp
- Use `-q` flag to ignore untracked items
- It can be used for getting a list of files added

    ```sh
    ‚ù± svn st -q | awk '{ print $2 }'
    dir1/dir1_file1.txt
    dir2
    ```


## svn add

Should probably just simply pass to `svn add` every file added, that resides within the repo
